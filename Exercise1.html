    <p>The Origin of Dosa: Unraveling the Story Behind South India’s Iconic Dish    
November 19, 2024

By Swiggy Explorer

Dosa is among the most iconic and beloved dishes in South Indian cuisine, enjoyed for its crispy texture and versatile fillings. Known for its thin, crepe-like appearance and delicate flavour, dosa is a staple in South Indian households and has gained immense popularity worldwide. Often served with coconut chutney and sambar, dosa is not only a breakfast favourite but also a snack, lunch, or dinner option. Made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal, it is both nutritious and flavorful, celebrated for its lightness and digestibility. Though commonly associated with South India, the dosa’s influence has extended beyond, with variations seen in many other parts of India and even internationally. But this humble dish, now enjoyed globally, has ancient roots and an interesting evolution that traces back thousands of years. </p>
